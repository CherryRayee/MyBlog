    As robotics advances into an era of embodied intelligence, powered by emerging technologies like digital
    simulationand deep learning, the autonomous navigation of micro-robots in minimally invasive surgery is experiencing
    a rapid transformation. This shift takes place as we move our focus from the external world to the internal body.
    Starting with a brief summary of Heunis et al.'s work<Citation id="heunis2022">1</Citation>, we will identify the
    key modalities of micro-robots' autonomous navigation, considering both hardware and algorithm design. Amid the
    evolving robotics research landscape, there lies an emerging vision: transferring reinforced cognitive micro-robots
    from a real-time digital simulation to the complex vascular environment, with an emphasis on surgical efficiency and
    safety.

  To drive more practical advancements, we will explore technology-oriented details aligned with the interests of the
  Surgical Robotics Laboratory. We will examine tools like generative models for image preprocessing, Visual Language
  Models (VLMs) for cognitive development, Graph Transformers (GTs) for vascular segmentation, and Gaussian Splatting
  (GS) for flexible simulation. This will culminate in a discussion on collaborative swarm control. With a broad view of
  the current landscape and its technological components, the vision of micro-robots' autonomous navigation is no longer
  a distant dream, but an achievable reality.

## Core Paper Summary

<TextJustified>
  The internally magnetic rotablation catheter introduced by Heunis et al.<Citation id="heunis2022">1</Citation> aims to
  achieve arterial lumen navigation for minimally invasive arterial stenosis treatment. It can be equipped with
  sufficient actuation driven by a wireless controller to debulk calcified deposits, while also meeting clinical
  requirements for efficiency and safety. The structure follows a cyclic pattern, as depicted in{" "}

  **Dance in Chains:** Considering both medical and design constraints, this paper presents a power screw unit with a
  spring-loaded actuator that fits into the inner side of vessels, preventing arterial damage that might be caused by
  overheated electromagnetic coils. It promises to combine rotational and transluminal motion, enabling efficient
  deposit removal through internal magnetic forces.
</TextJustified>

<TextJustified>
  **Prototype Design:** To ground the design in a practical prototype, Heunis et al.
  <Citation id="heunis2022">1</Citation> determines the position and geometry of the assembled electromagnetic coils based
  on the principle of maximizing the catheter tip forces in a simulated magnetic field. It also estimates the maximum screw
  pitch based on the plunger's stroke displacement and actuation cycle.
</TextJustified>

<TextJustified>
  **Simulation:** By measuring the coils' resistive temperature, the tip force and torque of the rotablation catheter,
  and the debulking ability of the prototype in a phantom model, the research validates that this magnetic,
  spring-loaded rotablation catheter can debulk calcified deposits and navigate through the artery with an intrinsic
  magnetic field.

  Based on the universal background and core aim of this foundational work, we will explore the promising future of
  surgical micro-robots, from the current research landscape to emerging technologies

## Where Are We? The Big Picture

<TextJustified>
  Current clinical procedures for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) focus on removing blockages in blood vessels through
  clinician-operated robotically steerable catheters<Citation id="hu2018">5</Citation>, which aim to embody inherent
  robotic autonomy and can be remotely controlled by a clinician<Citation id="killer2018">6</Citation>. We will explore
  the relevant research landscape from the perspective of the methodology framework, including actuation design and
  algorithmic layers composed of sensing and interaction, followed by an evolutionary thread of micro-robots' navigation
  to delve into the manifesting vision, as depicted in <a href="#figure-2">Figure 2</a>.

### Methodology Framework

<TextJustified>
  To construct a clear research landscape, we must identify the key principles of current technical methodologies,
  considering both hardware and software design. These principles point to the foundational concepts of micro-robots'
  navigation, while also focusing on the historical evolution that shapes their potential future development.
</TextJustified>

<TextJustified>
  **Actuation Design:** Serving the purposes of efficient and safe navigation through vessels, the actuation design of
  robotically steerable guidewires (RSGs) naturally aims to embrace at least three degrees of freedom (DoFs):
  translation for guidewire advancement into the vessels, bending to navigate through the vessels, and rotation for
  bending plane variation in 3D navigation<Citation id="scirobotics2023">7</Citation>. The competitive types of
  actuation designs can be classified as: 1) magnetically actuated guidewires<Citation id="sciadv2023">8</Citation>,
  which typically rely on controlling external magnetic fields to achieve the desired motion, and 2) motorized actuation
  systems<Citation id="shen2019">9</Citation>, which are more intrinsic but restricted to limited tendon-driven systems.
</TextJustified>

<TextJustified>
  While these actuation strategies provide the fundamental capabilities for micro-robots' movement, manipulating these
  motions to achieve precise treatment is still dependent on well-designed algorithmic implementations. These
  implementations require an integrated understanding of the vascular environment, agent movement, and their real-time
  interactions.
</TextJustified>

<TextJustified>
  **Tracking and Control:** From a control theory perspective, the algorithmic layers of micro-robots' navigation
  consist of two orientations: open-loop control and closed-loop control. In model-based open-loop control
  <Citation id="openloop2022">10</Citation>, an inverse model is used to compute and apply the required inputs for desired
  output motions, typically validated in simulated ex vivo vasculature and phantom models. However, considering the need
  for interaction with the environment—such as identifying the ideal target position of micro-robots in the vessels—emerging
  interest in closed-loop control<Citation id="closedloop2016">11</Citation> has formed a new trend.
</TextJustified>

<TextJustified>
  This approach relies on visual feedback from fluoroscopy, ultrasound, and MRI images to localize the guidewire and
  plan the next motion in real-time decision-making for control. Deep learning (DL)<Citation id="gnn2023">12</Citation>{" "}
  and reinforcement learning (RL)<Citation id="liu2025auto">13</Citation> have been proven to be powerful tools for
  understanding image data and enabling free-hand surgical manipulation through reward design, particularly within
  digital simulated vascular environments<Citation id="karstensen2025">14</Citation>.
</TextJustified>

### Navigation Evolution

<TextJustified>
  Revealed by the presented actuation and algorithm design framework, we can observe the evolution of micro-robots'
  navigation. In the early stages, manual navigation from the proximal end carried a high risk of vessel damage and
  surgical difficulty, especially when dealing with bifurcated vessel structures. To equip RSGs with autonomous
  navigation abilities, magnetic and motorized actuation strategies introduced embodied steerability as a transition
  stage in robot-assisted surgery.
</TextJustified>

<AbstractBox title="Key Challenge" variant="warning">
  <TextJustified>
    Challenges such as radiation overexposure from fluoroscopy, the potential scarcity of skilled physicians, and
    possible vessel perforation and damage during treatment highlight the urgent need to develop embodied intelligent
    micro-robots that can navigate the complicated vessel environment autonomously.
  </TextJustified>
</AbstractBox>

<TextJustified>
  Informed by this evolving research direction, we can envision a promising future for micro-robots' navigation,
  starting with the reconstruction of a high-quality simulation environment for RL controller training. This is further
  enhanced by integrating cognitive functions from vision-language models (VLM)<Citation id="huang2025">15</Citation>
  <Citation id="liu2025auto">13</Citation> into the navigation pipeline, enabling interactive operations through visual and
  verbal collaboration with skilled clinicians. Ultimately, this will improve surgical efficiency and provide a safer environment
  for minimally invasive surgeries.
</TextJustified>

## What Can We Do? The Promising Future

<TextJustified>
  To realize the intelligent and precise navigation of robotics, RL<Citation id="liu2025auto">13</Citation>
  <Citation id="modelrl2024">16</Citation> has been investigated as a possible solution for micro-robots' navigation in unstructured
  environments, especially where traditional navigation struggles with the highly dynamic and complex nature of the operational
  environment<Citation id="das2024">17</Citation>. Given the large data requirements for validated network training, it is
  essential to establish a high-quality real-time digital simulation environment<Citation id="karstensen2025">14</Citation>
  <Citation id="mao2025">18</Citation>, which can replicate the complex properties of the vascular environment.
</TextJustified>

<TextJustified>
  This environment provides a repetitive setting for data collection while saving time on physics modeling. With the aid
  of emerging technologies such as sim2real<Citation id="anderson2020">2</Citation>, world models
  <Citation id="lu2025">19</Citation>
  <Citation id="yu2025">20</Citation>, and digital twins<Citation id="hubotverse2025">21</Citation>, a technical roadmap
  exists for gradually designing a vivid digital simulation platform, as shown in <a href="#figure-3">Figure 3</a>.

    <strong>Figure 3:</strong> The promising future of micro-robots.
  </p>
</div>

<TextJustified>
  **2D Navigation:** Current research primarily focuses on 2D micro-robots' navigation, limited by the nature of sensing
  modalities that provide 2D images as feedback. For example, recent work<Citation id="liu2025auto">13</Citation>{" "}
  demonstrates a typical RL controller integrating data-driven and model-based control strategies, supervised by a 2D
  path planner in a vascular model. However, this static phantom vascular model, sensed by 2D images, cannot provide
  detailed structural information needed for micro-robots to avoid potential vessel damage in 3D space during
  navigation.
</TextJustified>

<TextJustified>
  **3D Navigation:** With the increasing use of digital simulations in industrial applications, advanced solutions
  <Citation id="karstensen2025">14</Citation> offer more sophisticated approaches for training and evaluating autonomous
  controllers solely on physical test benches, with camera and fluoroscopy feedback in a simulation platform-based environment.
  This approach enhances comparability across studies. However, improvements are still needed in areas such as robot agents'
  formation, actuation models, and capturing the complexity of vascular structures.
</TextJustified>

<AbstractBox title="Emerging Technology" variant="success">
  <TextJustified>
    Emerging techniques like Gaussian Splatting (GS) can help reconstruct a more realistic vascular model with flexible
    material variations and structural details, providing additional image data from different viewpoints to improve
    tracking and planning performance for micro-robots.
  </TextJustified>
</AbstractBox>

<TextJustified>
  **4D Navigation:** While space reconstruction has been increasingly explored, temporal factors of the vascular
  environment—such as blood flow speed and variations in stenosis—are still underdeveloped. Borrowing concepts from
  Four-dimensional Digital Subtraction Angiography (4D DSA)<Citation id="zhang2024">22</Citation>
  <Citation id="liu2024">23</Citation>, micro-robots' 4D navigation could incorporate time-varying edits of the vascular
  environment and agent movement, offering enhanced support for clinicians' operations or autonomous tracking and planning.
</TextJustified>

<TextJustified>
  **Cognitive 4D Navigation:** Although ultimate autonomous navigation is a revolutionary development, it would be more
  adaptable if we can preserve the possibility of interactive collaboration with professional clinicians. In cases of
  unexpected situations, instant supervision from certified and skilled operators would ensure safety and precision. By
  transforming image information and verbal instructions into a unified action framework, vision-language models (VLMs)
  <Citation id="huang2025">15</Citation>
  <Citation id="liu2025auto">13</Citation> provide a bridge to connect the data-driven knowledge from simulated
  environments with clinicians' expert intelligence, improving safety and precision during micro-robots' navigation.
</TextJustified>

## How Will We Do? The Devil in the Details

<TextJustified>
  By exploring the previous publications from the Surgical Robotics Laboratory, we can focus on detailed improvements in
  several key areas. First, we can explore image preprocessing techniques that utilize generative models to improve
  image accuracy, such as removing artifacts from ultrasound images to enhance the performance of the navigation
  tracker. Second, we can focus on obtaining accurate vascular segmentation by combining Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and
  Vision Transformers (ViT) to localize micro-robots, leveraging advanced image feature extraction techniques that
  encapsulate both local and global information, as demonstrated in <a href="#figure-4">Figure 4</a>.

</div>

<TextJustified>
  **Generative Model for Preprocessing:** Delving into the magnetic manipulation system, cardiovascular ultrasound
  imaging, or echocardiography, has become one of the most important advances in providing real-time and cost-efficient
  cardiac imaging. However, it may suffer from haze artifacts<Citation id="dehaze2024">24</Citation>. To help the
  downstream tracker recognize the relationship between the micro-robot agent and the vascular environment robustly, and
  to provide a reliable foundation for constructing a high-quality 3D simulation platform, we can adopt emerging
  generative models for preprocessing the ultrasound images<Citation id="yu2025proc">25</Citation>
  <Citation id="preprocessing2024">26</Citation>
  <Citation id="dehaze2024">24</Citation>. This approach avoids the labeling costs for data preparation and improves
  image quality through elegant reconstruction techniques.
</TextJustified>

<TextJustified>
  **GNN and ViT for Segmentation:** Accurate segmentation of vascular structures is crucial for constructing a precise
  tracking modality and a high-quality simulation model with a clear graph representation. However, a core challenge in
  medical image analysis remains due to the complexity of elongated, thin, and low-contrast vessels. Graph Neural
  Networks (GNNs) have proven to be powerful tools for segmenting vascular structures in micro-robot tracking
  <Citation id="gnn2023">12</Citation>, but they struggle with capturing global information.
</TextJustified>

<TextJustified>
  Recent advancements have introduced various Transformer variants, collectively known as Graph Transformers (GTs),
  which have demonstrated performance that matches or even surpasses that of GNNs<Citation id="min2022">27</Citation>.
  By combining GNN's inherent inductive biases for locality and scale in medical imaging with Vision Transformers
  (ViT)'s efficient parallel processing capability for large datasets and global information integration, we can balance
  local and global features. This enables the aggregation of messages from distant nodes, thereby alleviating the issues
  of over-smoothing and over-squashing to some extent<Citation id="mu2025">28</Citation>.
</TextJustified>

<TextJustified>
  **Real-time Rendering for Simulation:** To reconstruct a high-quality simulation platform as a digital twin of the
  real vascular environment, we should consider three main aspects: (1) fine-grained internal reconstruction with
  modeling of blood hemodynamics, (2) constructing digital assets for various micro-robot agent forms and actuation
  strategies, and (3) integrating the digital agents and vascular models into a specific medical simulator to drive the
  reinforcement learning (RL) controller training.
</TextJustified>

<TextJustified>
  Current research has provided potential solutions for these aspects<Citation id="liang2025">4</Citation>
  <Citation id="zhang2024">22</Citation>
  <Citation id="liu2024">23</Citation>
  <Citation id="chen2024">29</Citation>. However, there is still a lack of a mature simulation pipeline that integrates the
  promising real-time Gaussian Splatting (GS) rendering, such as how to reconstruct the inner structure of vessels from medical
  imaging, how to model different micro-robot agents with corresponding actuation designs, and how to choose an appropriate
  simulation platform for specific vascular structures.
</TextJustified>

<TextJustified>
  **Extension to Collaborative Swarm Control:** Finally, expanding our discussion from a single-agent to swarm-based
  micro-robots, many modalities follow a similar exploration path, such as tracking and planning and control within a
  simulation platform construction paradigm. However, there are additional aspects<Citation id="swarm2024">30</Citation>{" "}
  that we must consider, such as simulating more variations of actuation, like acoustic and light actuation, exploring
  alternative imaging techniques like optical coherence tomography, and implementing more complex collaborative control
  patterns, such as transformation and formation control.
</TextJustified>

## Conclusion

<TextJustified>
  Inspired by the magnetic rotablation catheter research, we have developed a reinforced cognitive framework for
  micro-robots' autonomous navigation. The current landscape demonstrates a clear evolution from manual operation toward
  embodied intelligence, with a promising future relying on a high-fidelity digital ecosystem that leverages GS for
  realistic vascular simulation and RL for sophisticated controller training. The ultimate vision culminates in
  cognitive 4D navigation, where VLMs enable intuitive collaboration between micro-robots and clinicians, merging
  data-driven precision with expert oversight.

<AbstractBox title="Research Vision" variant="success">
  <TextJustified>
    By integrating the research direction of the Surgical Robotics Laboratory with targeted technological advancements,
    this vision becomes achievable through: generative models for image preprocessing, combined GNN and ViT
    architectures for precise segmentation, and a real-time rendering pipeline for simulation. The autonomous navigation
    of micro-robots is not a distant aspiration but an unfolding reality—a concerted effort to translate the reinforced
    cognitive framework from digital twins to the human body, ushering in a new era of minimally invasive surgery.
